Thanks for stopping by!

This implementation of the base game and Seafarers extension of Catan by Klaus Teuber was programmed in 2023/24, for private, non-commercial use only.
The main purpose of making yet another implementation of this game was dabbling around with WebGL, WebRTC, WebSockets and a big appreciation of the game.

Enjoy! Sam
